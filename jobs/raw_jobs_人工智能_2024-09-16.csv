**Company description**

**Dance4Healing: www.dance4healing.com**

An award-winning social venture, Dance4Healing is an NIH-funded, patented AI telehealth platform that pairs elders/chronic disease patients/caregivers with compatible buddies to build fun, lasting habits through recorded and live video classes (Imagine YouTube + Zoom + eHarmony for health buddies). Inspired by founder Amy Li’s Stage IV cancer recovery, our mission is to make healthy habits accessible, supportive, and fun, enriching the lives of people of all abilities, ages, races, and genders. Our vision is to be the global cultural hub leading the experience in bridging art and health.

Our work environment includes:

* 100% remote
* Regular team bonding exercise
* Flexible hours with communication
* Communication and leadership coaching

**Did you know:** Creative Arts Therapy (CAT) improves the Quality of Life by 50% and reduces pain by 59% for cancer patients? Dancing reduces the risk of dementia by 76% and Cardiovascular death by 46%? Despite these published medical studies, **Arts and Health intervention (A&H: Music, Dance, Arts)** is severely under-utilized in healthcare; Dance4Healing is teaming up with Stanford to change that. We started with the Stanford Cancer Supportive Care Program and won over 20 awards, including the **AARP CES annual pitch ""People's Choice Award""**. We were selected for the **National Institute of Health** (NIH) Applicant Assistance Program (AAP), a 10-week coaching program designed to assist small businesses applying for Phase I SBIR/STTR funding. Dance4Healing is now funded by the **National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD)and** has additional NIH and NSF grants (total ~$ 1 million) pending.

**StageIV.org:** A global network of leaders who champion creative arts therapy, integrative medicine, patient advocacy, and healthcare innovation. Inspired by Dance4Healing‘s founder Amy Li’s Stage IV cancer journey and her commitment to patient advocacy and healthcare transformation, Stage IV {Wicked Wisdom} Media Network is an educational arm of Dance4Healing including Stage IV Show (https://bit.ly/StageIVShow), Book (https://bit.ly/StageIV\\_Book), and Web Magazine (https://www.stageiv.org).
