We are looking for Integrated Audit Data Analyst, Intern to join the Corporate Audit Team. This role is open to graduate and undergraduate students; however graduate students with Audit experience are preferred. Corporate Audit conducts internal audits of all of State Street’s business lines, including Investment Services, Global Markets, Global Advisors, and corporate functions. In this position, you will play a data specialist role as part of dynamic and cross functional teams responsible for the execution of individual audit engagements. In this role, you will work under the direction of audit project lead or an experienced auditor to support the execution of the audit through the use of data analytics. This will require both audit skills, as well as an understanding of data analytics, to allow the audit intern to interface with business partners, and to learn about and contribute to the execution of control design assessments and operational effectiveness testing, development of audit test conclusions and drafting summary observations. The Integrated Audit Data Analyst Intern will partner with both the Data Analytics team and the business audit team to design data-driven test approaches in audit projects. You will also work with the business audit teams to analyze the results of data analytic control tests to identify potential control weaknesses. This role is based out of Boston, MA, USA.
Why this role is important to us
The team you will be joining plays an important role in the overall success of the organization. Across the globe, institutional investors rely on us to help them manage risk, respond to challenges, and drive performance and profitability; regulators rely upon us to provide assurance that the bank operates in a manner that is compliant with key banking regulations to properly manage risks to the company and the global financial systems. To make that happen we need teams like yours to help navigate employees and the organization as a whole. In your role, you will help us build resilience and execute day to day deliverables at our best.

* Engage with both the Business Audit Team and the Data Analytics Team to ensure an understanding of business processes and data analytics capabilities, to drive better data analytics outcomes.
* Obtain and analyze evidentiary data as a basis for forming objective opinions on the adequacy and effectives of controls under review. This may include previously-identified data analytics approaches; however the Integrated Audit Data Analyst Intern will be expected to leverage their data analytics knowledge to partner with the central Data Analytics team and the business audit team to assist in the design and execution of enhanced analytics approaches.
* Review corrective actions taken by management to improve deficient conditions.
* Escalate potential issues / obstacles to audit management along with proposed solutions.
* Develop and maintain understanding of internal State Street products and processes, relevant industry and regulatory topics, and data analytics best practices.
* Develop an understanding of State Street data constructs, systems, and processes, to better position the team for more effective data analytics-based auditing.
* Share successes and challenges with peer Integrated Data Analysts and the Data Analytics Team to increase the future success of the Data Analytics program.


What we value
These skills will help you succeed in this role:* The ability to operate in a complex, non-routine and fast-paced environment that requires working independently and as part of a team.

You will immerse yourself into Bose for 3 months and get the opportunity to grow the skills you learned in the classroom with hands on work experience. By the time you end your time with us, you will have been given the opportunity to truly make a real impact in the future of Bose and your career!
Opportunities don't stop at your day-to-day work. While you're getting an in depth look at your area of expertise, we'll expose you to other areas of the company. Our Interns are given the opportunity to connect with senior leadership across the business to understand different perspectives at Bose. You'll network with other Interns and colleagues to grow your network for the future!
Timeframe - June-August 2025
THE ROLE
The goal of our team is to develop novel AI-powered audio processing algorithms. The twist is that our algorithms must run in real-time, on physical devices, for applications such as voice pickup, hearing augmentation and ones we haven't even thought of yet. As part of the team, you will work with experts in machine learning (ML), digital signal processing (DSP), software engineering and psychoacoustics to prototype and implement new algorithms.
Bose has a strong history of combining creative thinking with cutting-edge technology in the audio domain. We are looking for candidates passionate about machine learning and audio to help us shape the next chapter in the future of Bose!  

  

Responsibilities:  

* Most of your time will be devoted to prototyping, implementing and evaluating ML algorithms, curating and developing internal resources, and presenting your findings.
* You will integrate your novel solutions into existing systems and platforms to showcase new (proof of concept) solutions.
* You will be able to contribute to projects, which will be shipped to Bose customers, apply for patents, and/or submit papers to top-tier AI and signal processing conferences (e.g., NeurIPS, ICASSP, Interpeech, etc.).

  

Education:  

* Pursuing or recently finished a graduate-level degree in ML, Computer Science, Music Technology or a related field.

  

Skills:  

* Practical knowledge of applied audio ML and digital signal processing (DSP).
* Hands-on experience with at least one of the following research topics: source separation, speech enhancement, microphone array signal processing (e.g., beamforming), generative audio modeling, TinyML (e.g., compression, quantization, pruning).
* Familiarity with methods for spatial audio synthesis, room acoustics simulation or acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) is a plus.
* Experience developing ML algorithms in Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch and/or C/C++.
* Familiarity with standard version control practices.
* Familiarity with the following technologies is also preferred: TFLite, ONNX and/or AWS stack.
* Strong communication skills. You will present your work internally to a large, interdisciplinary audience on a regular basis.
