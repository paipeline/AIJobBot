* You will integrate your novel solutions into existing systems and platforms to showcase new (proof of concept) solutions.
* You will be able to contribute to projects, which will be shipped to Bose customers, apply for patents, and/or submit papers to top-tier AI and signal processing conferences (e.g., NeurIPS, ICASSP, Interpeech, etc.).

  

Education:  

* Pursuing or recently finished a graduate-level degree in ML, Computer Science, Music Technology or a related field.

  

Skills:  

* Practical knowledge of applied audio ML and digital signal processing (DSP).
* Hands-on experience with at least one of the following research topics: source separation, speech enhancement, microphone array signal processing (e.g., beamforming), generative audio modeling, TinyML (e.g., compression, quantization, pruning).
* Familiarity with methods for spatial audio synthesis, room acoustics simulation or acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) is a plus.
* Experience developing ML algorithms in Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch and/or C/C++.
* Familiarity with standard version control practices.
* Familiarity with the following technologies is also preferred: TFLite, ONNX and/or AWS stack.
* Strong communication skills. You will present your work internally to a large, interdisciplinary audience on a regular basis.
